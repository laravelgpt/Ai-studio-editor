# üî• AI Studio Editor

A web-based, VS Code-style playground built with **Next .js 15 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript** that lets you:

* Edit code with the Monaco Editor
* Chat with an AI assistant (powered by Google Gemini via **Genkit**)
* Auto-explain, fix, or autocomplete code fragments
* Run JavaScript snippets inside the browser sandbox
* Create / rename / delete files & folders in a mock in-memory file-system
* Import or export an entire project as a ZIP
* Toggle dark / light themes, search in files, and more

All UI components are built with **Radix UI**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Lucide icons** for a familiar desktop-editor feel.  
The project is licensed under GPL-3.0.
